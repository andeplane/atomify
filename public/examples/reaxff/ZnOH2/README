     - Based on QM calculations for Zn(s), ZnO(s), 
     and Zn hydroxide clusters [Zn(OH)2 and O(ZnOH)2], 
     ReaxFF parameters were generated for Zn-O and 
     Zn-Zn bond energies and for Zn-O-Zn, O-Zn-O, 
     O-Zn-Zn and Zn-O-H valence angle energies.

     - QM calculations were performed for the four 
     crystal polymorphs of the wurtzite, zincblende, 
     rocksalt and caesium chloride structures 
     (the structures are also referred to as h-ZnS, 
     c-ZnS, NaCl and CsCl, respectively).
