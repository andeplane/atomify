# To use Langevin dynamics in LAMMPS you need both "fix langevin" and "fix nve".
# (See http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_langevin.html for details.)

# Keep the chaperonin fixed.  Only let the protein move.

# Notes:
# The temperature is in reduced units and is set to 0.25
# which is the folding temperature for the frustrated protein
# The inverse-damping-rate "damp" (which has units of time) is set to 1.0,
# as it was in the paper.  (Hopefully folding times should be similar.)
