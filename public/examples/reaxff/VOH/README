have not been explicitly trained against may produce

     - The ReaxFF force field parameters have been fit 
     to a large quantum mechanics (QM) training set containing over 700 
     structures and energetics related to bond dissociations, angle 
     and dihedral distortions, and reactions between hydrocarbons 
     and vanadium oxide clusters. In addition, the training set 
     contains charge distributions for small vanadium oxide clusters 
     and the stabilities of condensed-phase systems 
     including V2O5, VO2, and V2O3 in addition to metallic V (V0).
