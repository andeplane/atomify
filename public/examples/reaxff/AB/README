   - QM data were generated describing the single and 
   (if relevant) double and triple bond dissociation 
   for all B/N/O/H combinations. These data were used 
   to derive initial ReaxFF bond parameters, and all 
   calculations were performed using DFT with the B3LYP 
   functional and the Pople 6-311G** basis set.

   - The training set was then extended with QM data 
   describing angular distortions in a set of small 
   AB-related (AB = H3N-BH3) molecules. These data 
   were used to derive the initial ReaxFF angular 
   parameters.

   - The training set was extended with reaction barriers 
   for key reaction steps such as H2 release 
   from AB, dimerization of H2B-NH2 and reaction 
   energies associated with H2 release from AB and with AB 
   oxidation.
