     - The initial force field parameters for the 
     Fe-Fe parameters were taken from an 
     earlier force field development 
     project on bulk-iron metal, based on 
     DFT-calculations on antiferromagnetic 
     BCC and FCC. The DFT data can 
     be found in Ref 31 of the above-mentioned manuscript. 
     The O/H parameters were taken from the ReaxFF bulk 
     water description. The Fe/Fe and O/H parameters were 
     kept fixed to these initial values,
     whereas the Fe/O parameters were reoptimized 
     against the quantum mechanical results 
     presented in the above-mentioned manuscript.

     - Detailed information on the force field parameters 
     is given in the supporting information of the above mentioned
     manuscript.
