# Pull Request Best Practices

## PR Titles and Descriptions

### Title Requirements
- All PR titles MUST follow conventional commit format with prefixes:
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `test:` for test-related changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
- Titles should be descriptive and clearly indicate what the PR does
- NEVER use generic titles like "Solve issue X and create PR" or "Fix issue Y"
- Include the key change in the title (e.g., "fix: ColorModifier bugs - swapped min/max calculation")

### Description Requirements
- All PR descriptions MUST include:
  1. A clear summary section explaining what the PR does
  2. Reference to related GitHub issues using "Fixes #XXX" or "Closes #XXX" format
  3. A "Changes" section listing what was modified
  4. An "Impact" or "Benefits" section explaining why this change matters
  5. Reference to any prerequisites or related PRs if applicable

### Background Agent PRs
- When creating PRs via background agents or automated tools:
  - Always reference the related GitHub issue number in the title or description
  - Use descriptive titles that explain the actual change, not just "Solve issue X"
  - Include proper description sections as outlined above
  - Ensure the PR title matches the issue's title or key change

### PR Template Structure

All PRs should follow this structure:
```
## Summary
[Clear one-paragraph explanation of what this PR does]

Fixes #XXX (or Closes #XXX)

## Changes
- [List of specific changes made]

## Impact / Benefits
[Explain why this change matters]

## Files Modified
- [List of files changed, if not obvious from changes]

[Any additional context, testing notes, etc.]
```

## PR Creation Workflow

When creating a pull request:
1. Create the PR as a draft with proper title and description
2. Wait 1 minute for Gemini PR reviewer to process and add comments
3. Check for review comments
4. If comments are not yet present, wait another 30 seconds
5. Address any review comments from Gemini
6. Keep the PR in draft status until all reviews are addressed
7. Only mark the PR as ready for review once all review comments have been addressed
