# Jupyter notebooks in Atomify

Atomify is a browser only solution where all simulations run in the browser.
Thanks to [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), we offer a
Jupyter notebook solution that also runs fully in the browser. That it runs in the browser
means there are some limits on performance and memory, but should be more than
sufficient to analyze the simulations created with Atomify.

Python packages can be installed by running `%pip install packagename` in a cell,
and needs to be reinstalled each Jupyter notebook session.
