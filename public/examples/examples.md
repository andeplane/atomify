Atomify comes with a bunch of example simulations. You can easily create your own set of simulations for e.g. teaching by using this  [Github template](https://github.com/andeplane/atomify-examples-template). Simulations can contain input scripts, data files, Python notebooks for simulation analysis.

If you have any feedback, ideas or just a cool simulation we could add to the examples, create an issue on [https://github.com/andeplane/atomify](https://github.com/andeplane/atomify) or contact me at [andershaf@gmail.com](mailto:andershaf@gmail.com).
